          True if either:
            (1) the tool_execution_results contain enough information to fulfill the planner directive, or
            (2) no tool was used, but the model response itself satisfies the user's request and planner prompt.

          False if the tool output was missing, irrelevant, or the model reply lacked sufficient factual grounding.
      summary_of_facts:
        type: "string"
        description: >
          If is_sufficient is true, return the key facts used or inferred (e.g., 'The weather is 19Â°C and sunny.').

          If is_sufficient is false, explain the factual gap briefly, and suggest a correction (e.g., 'No temperature was given. The tool should specify a precise value.').
