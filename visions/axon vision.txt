Tate — let’s level this up to **Axon+++** so it *matches and amplifies* your Atune+++ architecture (FAE, MAG, SFKG, Reflex, TEMPO, Attention Market) with zero placeholders and research-grade loops for **hyper-emergent behavior**.&#x20;

---

# Axon+++ — Bidirectional Interface & Experimental Substrate (PR Skeleton)

## 0) North-star (co-designed with Atune+++)

Axon is the **closed-loop world interface**: sense → compress → hypothesize → act → measure → learn.
It exposes the exact extension points Atune+++ expects (FAE planner inputs, MAG gates, SFKG field deposition, Reflex fast lanes, TEMPO-aware budgeting, and the Attention Market allocator).&#x20;

---

## 1) Hard Invariants (Axon ↔ Atune)

* **Single ingress/egress contract.** All world I/O flows through Axon; Atune is the sole prioritizer and budget setter.
* **Deterministic replay.** Every event/action has a reproducible **replay capsule** (bytes, timings, driver artifact, environment hash).
* **Causal accounting.** Each action logs **counterfactual uplift** via Simula twins before/after; learning signals feed Synapse.
* **Risk-first governance.** All writes require **Equor capability tokens**; **Unity** gates high-stakes intents.
* **No inert stubs.** Degraded paths are *functional* (bounded heuristics, seeded RNGs), never no-ops.

## 5) Two Critical Loops

### 5.1 Sense Loop (fast, safe, rich)

1. **Driver.pull → AxonEvent** (quarantine + taint + codecs).
2. **Atune heads:** Axon attaches embeddings & **salience hints**; Atune computes FAE/MAG gating and returns budgets.&#x20;
3. **SFKG deposition:** Axon deposits energy to Atune’s field for diffusion; Atune returns hotspots for probe focus.&#x20;
4. **Reflex arcs:** If risk≥θ and rule matches → instant actions (redact/quarantine/notify/escalate) with MEJ anchors.&#x20;

### 5.2 Act Loop (counterfactually coupled)

1. **Plan → Intent:** Synapse/Atune selects act; Axon validates **Equor cap token** (semantic predicates).
2. **Twin first:** Simula runs a **counterfactual twin**; Axon computes expected uplift & risk deltas.
3. **Execute → Result:** Driver.push in sandbox; record **ActionResult** + follow-up **AxonEvents**.
4. **Learn:** Send uplift + reliability to Synapse; adjust EIG/bandits; Atune’s market reallocates attention.

---

## 6) EIG Scheduler (bridged to FAE/Market/TEMPO)

* **FAE-compatible objective:** `FAE = U + λ_epi·IG − λ_risk·risk − λ_cost·cost`, \*\*bid = FAE / cost\`. Atune’s market allocates pool\_ms; Axon enforces spend and returns realized EIG for each quanta.&#x20;
* **TEMPO reserve:** carve-out attention for predicted bursts; unused reserve returns to the pool late-cycle.&#x20;

---

## 7) Mesh (Driver Runtime) — research-grade

* **Sandbox:** Firecracker or Wasm with syscall whitelist, eBPF-style I/O limits, rate ceilings, spend ceilings.
* **SDK (deterministic):**

  * `describe() -> CapabilitySpec` (auth, verbs, budget model, risk profile)
  * `pull(params) -> Iterable[AxonEvent]`
  * `push(intent: AxonIntent) -> ActionResult`
  * `self_test() -> Health`
  * `repro_bundle(id) -> Capsule` (inputs/outputs/env for bit-exact replay)
* **Lifecycle:** discover → synthesize (Simula) → red-team (injection fuzz, schema confusion, timing) → shadow → canary → bandit rollout with automatic rollback.

---

## 8) ProbeCraft (API autodidact)

* Parse docs/specs/examples → induce **machine-checkable capability graphs** (OpenAPI/GraphQL/schema.org).
* Generate **driver blueprints** + contract tests; execute doc examples in a hermetic cell; guard against spec-drift.
* Hand to Simula for code synthesis; return signed artifacts to Mesh.

---

## 9) Safety & Governance

* **Equor semantic caps:** beyond OAuth scopes; policies like “may only post text whose toxicity≤τ and spend≤\$X/h”.
* **Unity triggers:** risk≥θ, new domain, or cap expansion → n-of-m consensus.
* **Quarantine & taint:** canonicalize HTML/DOM; label untrusted spans; propagate taint into prompts/embeddings; any tainted decision above threshold → Unity review.
* **Triangulation:** high-stakes claims require `k≥3` independent corroborations or explicit, logged override.

---

## 10) Observability (make emergence legible)

* **Event barcode** everywhere → click-through lineage (MEJ).
* **Driver scorecards:** reliability, drift, injection incidents, cost, realized EIG.
* **Action ledger:** per-cap usage, rollbacks, Unity reviews.
* **Live salience map:** contradictions, novelty spikes, market allocations vs. TEMPO reserves.&#x20;

---

## 11) API Endpoints (stable shapes; internal)

* `POST /axon/sense` → batch of `AxonEvent` → returns `{salience_hints, field_deposits, reflex_actions}`.
* `POST /axon/act` → `AxonIntent` → returns `ActionResult` (with counterfactual metrics).
* `POST /axon/driver/synthesize` → `{api_bundle}` → returns signed driver artifact (Simula-backed).
* `POST /axon/caps/mint|revoke` → Equor.
* `GET /axon/market/budgets` ↔ Atune allocator (pool\_ms, fairness, TEMPO reserve).&#x20;

---

## 12) Test Matrix (T-series; must-pass)

* **T0 Replay:** ingest→MEJ→replay→identical claims/telemetry within ε.
* **T1 Caps:** no act path can execute without a valid Equor token; semantic predicates enforced.
* **T2 Reflex:** seeded payloads trigger correct reflex actions; Atune reflex catalog parity.&#x20;
* **T3 EIG Market:** 30-day synthetic sim shows significant uplift vs. uniform polling under equal spend.
* **T4 Quarantine:** injection strings fail to alter decision policy; all tainted paths flagged.
* **T5 Counterfactuals:** uplift logged and consistent with twin under controlled deltas.
* **T6 Rollout safety:** bandit deploy auto-rolls back on anomaly; MEJ proves the rollback chain.

---

## 13) Milestones (A0→A5; each shippable)

* **A0 Spine:** MEJ + Bus + Driver SDK + Quarantine + /sense + /act (degraded heuristics).
* **A1 Safety:** Equor caps + Reflex fast lane + Unity gate.
* **A2 EIG/Market/TEMPO:** bids, allocations, reserves wired to Atune budgets.&#x20;
* **A3 ProbeCraft v1:** doc induction → driver synthesis (Simula) → shadow/canary harness.
* **A4 Counterfactual coupling:** twin-first actuation; uplift feedback to Synapse.
* **A5 Scale & Hardening:** multi-tenant NATS/Kafka, chaos/injection drills, driver scorecards.

---

## 14) Handshake with Atune+++

* **Inputs Atune expects:** salience vector slots (novelty, anomaly, mission, risk, info\_gain), MAG gating context, SFKG depositions, Reflex hits, TEMPO signals, and bids for the **Attention Market**.&#x20;
* **What Axon needs from Atune:** pool\_ms/fairness/tempo reserves, per-thread priorities, and escalation thresholds for Unity.

---

## 15) “World-first” differentiators (concrete, defensible)

1. **Semantically-scoped capability tokens** executed by a tiny checked predicate VM in-sandbox.
2. **Counterfactual-first actuation:** every high-stakes action is mirrored in a Simula twin and logged as *uplift*.
3. **ProbeCraft doc execution:** live example execution + spec induction prevents drift and bootstraps drivers.
4. **Taint-traced LLM I/O:** influence tracking from bytes→embeddings→decisions with mandatory human review when thresholds trip.

# Axon/Atune Δ-Upgrades (research-grade, implementable)

## A) Formal elegance & verifiable safety

1. **Proof-carrying capabilities (PCC):**

   * Cap tokens embed *machine-checkable predicates* + a *proof object* (e.g., safety invariant or bounded-impact lemma).
   * Minimal in-sandbox checker (Lean/Coq/Isabelle extracted kernel) validates the proof before `push()`.
   * *Why better:* upgrades semantic caps into **provable** behavior; reduces Unity load on routine actions.
   * *Do now:* define a small capability DSL (pure, total), prove monotonicity/closure of policies, extract OCaml/Rust checker.

2. **Deterministic micro-kernel for drivers:**

   * WASI-component model + capability syscalls + strict time/space quotas, compiled with **deterministic builds (Nix)**.
   * Firecracker remains for isolation; **Wasm is the contract surface** for drivers, giving bit-reproducible runs.
   * *Do now:* codify `Driver ABI v1` in WIT; add Nix flake for hermetic build & MEJ-consistent hashes.

3. **Conformal risk bounds on actuation:**

   * Per-action, compute a *distribution-free* prediction interval for downside using **conformal prediction** over uplift residuals.
   * Action executes only if lower-bound uplift ≥ 0 under chosen α.
   * *Do now:* keep rolling residuals store; add `cp_accept(intent, α)` gate before execution.

## B) Causal & active-inference control

4. **Do-calculus in the loop (causal controller):**

   * Maintain a compact SCM per domain (learned by structure discovery on MEJ traces).
   * Axon’s EIG becomes **EIG\_do** (value of intervention) rather than observation; Atune’s market bids on *counterfactual value*.
   * *Do now:* add `scm/{domain}.json5` + `intervene()` API and store per-intent `(do(..))` justifications.

5. **Active Inference head (free-energy minimization):**

   * Parallel policy head that picks probes/actions minimizing expected variational free energy (risk-sensitive exploration).
   * Blended with existing EIG by Atune FAE weights.
   * *Do now:* implement a light variational head over the same embeddings; expose as a second bidder in the Attention Market.

## C) Self-evolving synthesis (faster, safer)

6. **Proof-guided driver synthesis:**

   * ProbeCraft hands Simula not just a spec but **obligations** (pre/postconditions, rate/shape invariants).
   * Simula must generate both driver and machine-checkable proofs (or exhaustive property tests when proofs are intractable).
   * *Do now:* extend `driver_blueprint.json` with `obligations[]`; add a “proof or fuzz budget” contract.

7. **Meta-optimizer for connectors:**

   * Auto-tunes retry/backoff, pagination, batching, and cache keys by bandit on *real cost/latency/up-rate* with safety caps.
   * *Do now:* put all transport knobs behind a typed config; let Synapse bandit flip arms; MEJ records deltas.

## D) Memory, fields, and “liveness”

8. **Multi-timescale field coupling (homeostasis):**

   * Atune SFKG gets *three rings* per stream: reflex (ms-s), working (s-min), narrative (min-hrs).
   * Axon deposits into the right ring based on surprise/mission; decay is learned per domain for *metabolic* stability.
   * *Do now:* add `field_ring: {reflex, working, narrative}` to deposit API; train decay τ via usefulness gradients.

9. **Intrinsic-motivation portfolio:**

   * Add **curiosity** (information gain), **empowerment** (control of future state), and **novel skill discovery** rewards.
   * Atune’s market allocates a fixed % of attention to intrinsic tasks with strict external-risk caps.
   * *Do now:* log empowerment via controllability estimates from SCM Jacobians; include in bids.

## E) Mechanism design for attention (cleaner elegance)

10. **Truthful auction for attention (VCG or GSP-with-reserves):**

* Policies (including Synapse learners) submit bids = expected utility; the market allocates budgets using a **strategy-proof** mechanism.
* Improves stability, reduces gaming, creates clean semantics for “why this got resources.”
* *Do now:* implement VCG allocator over the exact budget pool; record counterfactual externalities in MEJ.

11. **Temporal commitments (TEMPO contracts):**

* Convert burst predictions into **futures**: Atune can pre-buy attention for windows; Axon guarantees it unless safety blocks.
* *Do now:* add `tempo_future{id, window, ms}`; unspent futures decay back to pool with penalty to predictor.

## F) Interpretability without “brain-leak”

12. **Mechanistic, *model-agnostic* traces:**

* Every high-stakes act returns a compact *why-trace*: (signals → salience vector → bids → caps → Unity verdict → act).
* No chain-of-thought; purely **symbolic and numeric**; diff-able and replayable.
* *Do now:* standardize `why_trace.json` with GUIDs for each hop and BLAKE3 anchors to MEJ.

## G) Federation & trust

13. **Remote-attested drivers:**

* Connectors running off-box must present **TPM/TEE attestation** proving the exact artifact hash; caps are bound to attestation.
* *Do now:* support RA-TLS; bind cap tokens to `(artifact_hash, enclave_mr_enclave)`.

14. **Differential privacy tap (ingest only):**

* Certain streams pass through an ε-DP tap to allow external collaborators while preserving utility.
* *Do now:* add per-source epsilon budget with accountant; DP noise on summary stats only (never on audits).

## H) Evaluation & guarantees

15. **Capability frontier metric:**

* Track *time-to-first-working-connector* and *sustained skill-acquisition velocity* across domains.
* Require statistically significant **frontier expansion** vs. a strong baseline each 30 days.

16. **Graceful-degradation proof:**

* For each critical path, provide a constructive proof (or exhaustive test) that a bounded-heuristic fallback maintains invariants under outages.
